 Alright, let's tackle some problems where you can apply the Bubble Sort algorithm in JavaScript.

Problem 1: Sort an Array of Numbers

You are given an array of unsorted numbers: [5, 1, 4, 2, 8]. Write a JavaScript function using Bubble Sort to sort this array in ascending order.

Problem 2: Sort an Array of Strings (Alphabetically)

You have an array of strings: ["banana", "apple", "cherry", "date"]. Implement Bubble Sort in JavaScript to sort this array alphabetically.

Problem 3: Sort an Array of Objects by a Specific Property

Consider an array of objects, where each object has a name and an age property:

JavaScript

const people = [
  { name: "Alice", age: 30 },
  { name: "Bob", age: 25 },
  { name: "Charlie", age: 35 },
  { name: "David", age: 28 },
];
Write a JavaScript function using Bubble Sort to sort this array of objects based on their age property in ascending order.

Problem 4: Partially Sorted Array

You have an array that is almost sorted, with only a few elements out of place: [1, 2, 3, 9, 5, 6]. Use Bubble Sort to sort this array. Observe how the optimization (checking if any swaps occurred in a pass) might be beneficial in this case.

Problem 5: Sort in Descending Order

Given an array of numbers: [10, 5, 8, 2, 7]. Modify the Bubble Sort algorithm to sort this array in descending order.

These problems should give you a good opportunity to practice implementing and applying the Bubble Sort algorithm in different scenarios within JavaScript. Feel free to ask if you get stuck or want to discuss your solutions!
